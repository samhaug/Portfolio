# K\_means station clustering

Split any collection of seismic stations into N subarrays of R degrees radius
with a minimum of X stations. The coordinates of subarrays in each station
should have a correlation coefficient less than C.

1. Execute cluster\_stations.py with chosen parameters

2. Map the resulting subarray files with simple\_station\_plot.sh
